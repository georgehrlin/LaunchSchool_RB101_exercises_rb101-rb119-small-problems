```ruby
s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods.inspect
```
I looked up the documentation on `Object#public_methods`. What I found is:

public_methods(all=true) â†’ array
Returns the list of public methods accessible to *obj*. If the *all* parameter is set to `false`, only those methods in the receiver will be listed.

I don't know what a receiver is. I am guessing that it refers to the object that the method is called on? (In this example, the receiver would be the value that the variable `s` poitns to?) Anyway, I tried specifying `all=false` and received a considerably shorter output of methods. I am assuming that is the answer to the question.
```ruby
s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods(all=false).inspect
```
### *Correct*

# Discussion
According to Phind AI, "the term 'receiver' refers to the object that is the target of a method call. When you call a method ob an object, the object on which the method is called is the receiver."

Also, the code can be refractored to:
```ruby
puts s.public_methods(false).inspect
```
`all` in `public_methods(all=true)` is an optional argument. If its value is `true` or omitted, it returns a list of all public methods available to the object. If the value is `false` instead, `Object#public_methods` limits the output to just those methods in the receiver.
